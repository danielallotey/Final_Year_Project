Proper const constructors and widgets
Better semantic structure
Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes


Eliminate pixel-perfect positioning that breaks on different screen sizes
Used flexible layouts that adapt to content and screen size

The clean code should be more maintainable, follow Flutter best practices, and be much easier to modify and extend in the future. The layout should also work better across different screen sizes and orientations.
